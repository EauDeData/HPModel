Flinders Street can be chaotic and intimidating, but there are things you can do to make your experience less stressful.

1) There are always station staff at the Swanson/Flinders St barriers, and they have radio contact with CCTV and police. Go directly to them if you have a problem - anything, even if you are feeling scared and not certain why. The ticket booth staff (on the opposite side of the dome) can also help. Generally standing near staff is a good idea.

2) Ticket inspectors (Authorised Officers) will gladly help. They are always present from 1am to 6am on ""weekend"" nights, and can usually be found on the concourse. If you are having a problem, ask them to escort you onto the train. With a worst case scenario, they can let you know which train will have inspectors on board for your trip home.

3) If you are especially stuck, train drivers tend to wait for their trains on the top of the escalators. Look for people in dark blue uniforms and steel caps. Several are women, and will understand what it's like! Cleaning staff also have radios, and there are often St Johns first aid crews on duty who can call for police.

5) Ride in the front of the train, and don't be afraid to push the emergency button (to alert the driver) or call 000. The ""carriage number"" is by the door. 

6) Regular safety problems? Get in touch with Metro on the customer feedback form via the website and give as much detail as possible (times/locations) so staffing or more patrols can be arranged.

This is not an exhaustive list, but there are options to explore if you're in trouble and can't get a hold of police/PSOs. 

(Also shhh! The ""secret"" toilet is in the Elizabeth St subway just before Platform 2/3 ramp. This one is less populated by weirdos and even has a decent seat.)",,,,Female,happy,,clairemckenna.email@gmail.com,,,,Claire,Anytime,,,0,0,,,,,,,

",,,,Woman,sad,,jhateleybrowne@gmail.com,,,,Jessica,Anytime,,,2,3,"BG: I've been walking this part of the trail at least once a week for the past four years. The infrastructure, public utility, plants and animals in the area make for interesting public space. I was walking here at 1pm on a Thursday last month under the taller of the two rail bridges where a man has been living rough. I noticed that he started occupying the area under the bridge after the Arden Street Bridge camp (people have been consistently sleeping under the bridge for the past 2/3 years) was removed earlier that month and assumed he had been moved along. I have been homeless and slept outside when I was younger and felt a mix of empathy and caution for this person. On this particular day he was standing between two support beams on the Metro Rail access road under the bridge, facing the creek/trail, pants around ankles, one hand on his dick, the other holding an inhalent to his face huffing. He was masturbating and appeared fully erect and he was two metres away from me. As this happened a cyclist went past, I don't think they noticed. A Metro Rail ute drove along the access road (in between the man and I) with two Metro Rail employees inside. The Metro Rail employees drove past and noticed the man, noticed me and kept driving (the man was technically on Melb Metro property, the employees where in a Melb Metro car, uniform and presumably on the clock). I felt unsafe which made me feel frustrated and angry. I muttered something along the lines, 'way to make me feel uncomfortable...' and started jogging to the next bridge. I have been avoiding this part of the trail recently. Initially I was determined to not let my fear of one incident shape my behaviour, after continuing to walk along that part of the trail I realised my walk was becoming consumed with thoughts of my safety. I have recently stopped walking this part of the trail, which is a shame. In the past I found it to be a strangely peaceful and beautiful place. Now it just feels like a series of dark corners.

To girls from regional WA, Melbourne is a cultural mecca. You can be whoever you want to be here. There is an innate vibrancy to this city. It's soaked into the streets and painted on the laneway walls.
 
I spend a lot of time around the city alone, at all hours of the day. I really value my independence, especially when it comes to transport. You see, I can't drive because I'm visually impaired. I have just enough vision to get around without a cane, so public transport is my jam. To me, it isn't tedious, it means glorious freedom. 
I am slightly vulnerable because of my vision, so I tend to over compensate and walk around the city at 11pm like a CEO heading to a board meeting. I also look rather odd because I have shockingly white hair, chalk white skin and purple eyes. This is because I have Albinism (which also causes the vision impairment). Because I look strange, strange people think I'm one of them and they attempt to interact with me. Usually it's fine: they just want to chat about the weather or say they like my hair. 
And sometimes it's not fine. 
Men on the street and on public transport have tried to interact with me, and because I can't see them I don't always know they are talking to me, so sometimes I don't answer. They then call me a 'stuck up bitch' and worse. I've been spat on, shouted at, and followed. 
And I refuse to let it change the way I live my life. 
I'm not scared of men, I never have been.
But if the things that happen to me happened to one of my friends, I'd be furious. I'd be outraged. 

As far as how to change the situation? I really don't know.

You have the right to respond the way you feel is appropriate- be proud that you maintained your demeanour, no one deserves to be harassed like that.
If it happened again- perhaps you could try in a quite loud voice- 'I dont know know you, leave me alone!'",,,

(I actually asked Police at a nearby train station what to do in that situation and they asked me to describe the guy, which I did, and they just nodded and said ""He's known to us."", which didn't exactly make me feel better)
The second time a man in a nice suit sat opposite me and kept asking me questions about my life and whether I had a boyfriend, and when I answered yes, he got in my face and asked me ""Does he look after you?"" with a weird smirk and raised eyebrow, and when I said ""Yeah, he's great."" he got closer and said ""But does he really? Because I can look after you better.""

Both times I've gotten off at different spots and made sure I wasn't followed before I continued home.

I live here, not a feminist but it can not be denied that this area is a noticeable cluster of very sexist, boorish, and SCARY behaviour. SO I will give trigger warning for the next parts, these are just a list of things that I can rattle off the top of my head right now.
I'm embarrassed to have female friends and relatives visit, they get yelled at, propositioned to get into passing cars. Only a few months ago my sister got one of these while walking her 3yr old daughter, an older man pulled up next to her and said ""Get in! Get in car now!"".
A group of young men tried to pull a girl into their car on Electric St 300m from this marker, near Jacana Station. 
There were 2 rapes of one severely drug-affected girl (she was only 17 or something) in the space of an hour at the end of Daley St near Jacana Station a few years ago by two separate men who were not together, one described as just riding past on a mountain bike and took advantage. Never caught.
A group of teenaged boys sexually abused two younger teenaged boys in Jack Roper Reserve, to the west of this marker, including sodomising them with a broom handle.
A womans body was found in a barrel in Jack Roper Reserve about 3 years ago, chopped into pieces (she had been killed by her son. Don't believe me, google it!).
On Camp Rd to the north, one night while driving I observed a car driving very slowly, as I got closer I could see he was following a girl riding on the foot path next to the road. I got suspicious and pulled over 100m ahead of them and he sped off past me. (This was about 5am, from the way she was dressed I think she was going to do an early shift in Macca's or Hungry Jacks). She was then afraid of me also and lurched out onto the road on her pushbike, slamming over the nature strip (probably buckled her wheels), pedalling frantically, I couldn't say anything or ask if she's OK because it would just make it worse.
At the very spot this marker is on, the roundabout, a man was stabbed to death in a traffic incident last year. I myself have been attacked at this spot in road rage incident (witnesses at the shops there said they would testify for me that it was attempted murder... but that's another story). 
Even as a man I have been yelled at from cars a few times (""Aussie Aussie Aussie, oink oink oink""), riding my bike at night had a man come out of the shadows almost screaming at me ""Come here! Come here!"" 
I've also observed a woman in a hihab get recognized by someone she knows but was so afraid she just ignored them, this car slowed down beside here and beeped the horn, she kept her head down and kept walking. I gathered from the manner of the occupants, the kind of polite, short beeps from the car that they weren't actually leering and being rude, but this woman was obviously so used to such behaviour that she wasn't game to look up or acknowledge that car. 
My naive young cousin came to stay with me once, she was 16 and kind of flattered by all the attention she got walking down the street, would sometimes just stand in my front yard watching the traffic go by... I was so paranoid and protective of her, she would talk to some of these guys who she thought were ""hot"" and it just felt like some bad dream unfolding.
Be warned. ","Thanks Anonymous male, good to know there are guys are looking out for us.",,,,,

""Pick up artist coaches"" regularly hold seminars and do ""daygame"" outings in the city. What this involves is encoraging each other to hit on women in the street during the day, manipulate them into giving them the responses they want and trying to get their phone number (if not trying to get them go somewhere with them as the one I met in this location did) some can be very agressive verbally or cross over into grabbing you by the arm or if youre on your phone snatching it out of your hand to get your attention. The fact their websites tell customers to message them for the address of their ""seminars"" instead of having an address on the site like a legit business says a lot about the nature of what they're doing.

If you're in the city getting a lot of the same lines from different guys in a short space of time and wondering what is going on here you've stumbled into a ""daygame"" outing. If you google ""pick up artist"" there is a lot of information on what they do so you know what to look out for. The material needs a trigger warning, what they say about women is pretty graphic and hateful.",,,,,,

Me and my friends had a joke rating for each station, Jacana was 5/5 skulls. To be fair it has improved since they bought in the armed transit officers but it's still very rough. Several times I've seen burnt out, stolen car shells across the road from here when I go to work in the morning. 
I have seen a passenger produce a small axe / tomahawk and smash a train window as it pulled out of the station. A few minutes later as I was walking along, the man came jogging past on the street trying to hide the axe in his shirt and hissed at me ""tell anyone and I'll kill you"".
Once a man acting erratically on the train tracks demanded my phone and wallet.
There are often teenagers on little dirt bikes riding on the footpath, and across the stations over pass.

All the women you see alone around here walk quickly and with their heads down (I wish they knew at least one of the creepy guys here was keeping an eye out for them)",,,,,,

At the last minute my boyfriend decided to come with me. We were on the tram from the CBD with a man sporting a very red face sitting across from us. It was clear he was inebriated but harmless, until we got to Brunswick. The tram had emptied and was mostly young women on the tram. The red faced man started to leer at women. I first noticed he was muttering something under his breath to a girl sitting next to him. She stood up and waited by the door and he followed her. She exited at the next stop and he followed her, but quickly gave up and got back on the tram. I alerted my boyfriend to his behaviour and we watched him stare at a young girl (thankfully fixated in her phone and unaware). We missed our stop as his behaviour was increasingly alarming. At the next stop the young girl on her phone stood to get off and the red faced guy followed her and tried to put his hands around her waist. My boyfriend intervened and gave him a shove, asking the poor confused girl if she knew him. By this stage most people had got off the tram and my boyfriend told him to get lost. We waited to make sure he didn't follow the young girl. I spotted him a few days later wearing a buttoned up shirt, marching with a rose in his hand, held staunchly in front of him (gave me the creeps). I've since seen him in the carpark of woolies - he has a triangle patch of hair on his bottom lip and short brown hair. Perhaps 40years old? Very odd and very creepy behaviour.

Some sort of mental health support centre would definitely be welcome here as it's possible that many of these people don't have the money or ability to seek help. ,,,,,,
